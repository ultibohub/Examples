  {Let's setup the mouse cursor so we can move it around the screen. The Raspberry Pi
   has cursor support built in to the graphics processor (GPU) so we can use that to
   display the cursor on screen.

   First we need to find out how big the screen is in pixels wide and high, to do this
   we ask for the default framebuffer device and then retrieve the properties which will
   give us the size as well as lots of other information.
   
   Get the default framebuffer device}

  ConsoleWindowWriteLn(Handle1,'Screen is ' + IntToStr(ScreenWidth) + ' pixels wide by ' + IntToStr(ScreenHeight) + ' pixels high');

  {We need to create a mouse cursor to display on the screen, for this example we'll just
   use the built in arrow which is the default cursor. If you read the description of the
   FramebufferDeviceSetCursor function you will see that you can define a block of pixels
   to create your own cursor shape, to use the default we simply pass zero or nil for all
   the parameters except the framebuffer device itself}
  FramebufferDeviceSetCursor(FramebufferDevice,0,0,0,0,nil,0);

  {Now we can turn on the cursor and set it to the middle of the screen.

   We'll use a couple of variables to track the position in response to mouse messages}
  CursorX:=ScreenWidth div 2;
  CursorY:=ScreenHeight div 2;

     and detach so as soon as you plug in a mouse the messages will start to arrive}

    {The MouseRead function needs a buffer to return TMouseData structures into, if
     you pass a buffer that is bigger than a single TMouseData then it can return
     multiple messages in one request and the Count variable will tell you how many
     messages were received}
