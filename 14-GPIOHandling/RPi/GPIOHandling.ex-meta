   "Description" : "Another example demonstrating the peripherals available in Ultibo, this time using the GPIO to detect a switch being opened or closed and turning an LED on or off in response.\r\n\r\nYou'll need a few components to try this example, an LED and a resistor plus some wire and a switch. Also recommended would be a breadboard or breakout board connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header to avoid the possibility of accidentally damaging the Pi.\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi A/B/A+/B+/Zero/ZeroW version"}
