      Notice that we check for Low to see if the switch is on, that's because we
      connected the switch from GPIO pin 18 to Ground so the value will be Low when
      the switch is closed and High when the switch is open.}

   {Instead of just looping over and over we can use the features of the GPIO controller
    to tell us when the pin our switch is connected to has changed. That way our thread
    does not consume any CPU time and other things can happen while we wait.}
    
   {There are two ways to wait for a GPIO pin to change, you can call GPIOInputWait which
    will cause the current thread to wait until the change occurs and then return.
    
    Alternatively we can use GPIOInputEvent to register a function to be called when the
    GPIO pin changes, this can be useful if you want your thread to be doing something else
    instead of waiting.
    
    We'll do both here just to show what happens.}

    begin
     {The switch is currently closed (value is Low) so we wait for it to change to High}
      
     {Let's register an event to call when the pin changes to High.
     
      The GPIO_TRIGGER_HIGH parameter tells the GPIO driver what change to wait for.
      
      You can also pass a data parameter to the event, this can be anything you want
      and is not used by the GPIO driver. For example you could use the same function
      for multiple different events and use the data to detect which one occurred.}
     GPIOInputEvent(GPIO_PIN_18,GPIO_TRIGGER_HIGH,INFINITE,@GPIOPinEvent,nil); 
     
     {And make the current thread wait for the change as well.
     
      The INFINITE parameter tells the driver to wait forever.}
     GPIOInputWait(GPIO_PIN_18,GPIO_TRIGGER_HIGH,INFINITE);
     
     {The thread will return here when the GPIO pin changes to High but sometimes switches
      do not change from open to closed cleanly and the contacts may "bounce" and cause a
      false change to occur. To stop this we add a little sleep here to give the switch time
      to settle before checking for the new state, this is called "debouncing".}
     Sleep(10);
    end
   else
    begin
     {The value is High so the switch must be open, wait for it to change to Low}
     
     {The same as above but in reverse, register an event for when the pin changes to Low}
     GPIOInputEvent(GPIO_PIN_18,GPIO_TRIGGER_LOW,INFINITE,@GPIOPinEvent,nil);
     
     {And wait as well for the change to Low}
     GPIOInputWait(GPIO_PIN_18,GPIO_TRIGGER_LOW,INFINITE);
