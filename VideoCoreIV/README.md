## Ultibo VideoCore IV examples

This folder contains examples showing how to use some of the features of the VideoCore IV Graphics Processor (GPU) in the Raspberry Pi.

The examples include some from the collection that are supplied with Raspbian (the hello_pi examples) as well as some from other sources and some specific to Ultibo.

These examples are included in the Ultibo core installer download and can be found from the Lazarus IDE by selecting Tools, Example Projects.. from the menu.

### VideoCore IV examples:

* HelloPi - A number of examples from the hello_pi collection that have been ported to run under Ultibo.

* OpenGLES - Some OpenGL ES examples written purely in Free Pascal.

* OpenVG - A pair of OpenVG examples showing what you can do with the VGShapes unit which we have ported to Free Pascal from A J Starks libShapes.

* RaspiCam - Two examples showing how RaspiStill and RaspiVid can be used at present to get access to the official Raspberry Pi camera from Ultibo.
