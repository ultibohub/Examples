VideoCore IV example - Hello JPEG

Decoding a JPEG using the hardware JPEG decoder (note that this example is a decoder only and does not display the picture).

This example directly imports the C code from the original hello_pi collection.

Make sure you also copy the Beetroot.jpg file from this folder to your SD card.
