VideoCore IV example - Hello Teapot

Using OpenGL ES and MMAL to show what the Raspberry Pi can do, if you haven't seen it before you should be impressed.

This example directly imports the C code from the original hello_pi collection.

Make sure you also copy the teapot.obj.dat and test.h264 files from the Media folder to your SD card.

Note: You must include the following setting in a config.txt file in the root directory of the SD card for this example:

gpu_mem=128
