VideoCore IV example - Hello Videocube

Combining the 3D cube from hello triangle with video from the previous example, very nice demonstration.

This example directly imports the C code from the original hello_pi collection.

Make sure you also copy the test.h264 file from the Media folder to your SD card.

Note: You must include the following setting in a config.txt file in the root directory of the SD card for this example:

gpu_mem=128
