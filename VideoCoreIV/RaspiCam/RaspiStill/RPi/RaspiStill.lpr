 {We need to call the MMALIncludeComponentVideocore function in order to force Free Pascal
  and the linker to include the relevant libraries that provide the VideoCore components
  to MMAL.

 {Because the Raspberry Pi camera uses the MMAL (Multimedia Abstration Layer) API to capture
  and encode images and there is currently no Free Pascal translation of the MMAL headers 
  we have recompiled the RaspiStill application into a library that can be included in an
  Ultibo program and called exactly the same way that you would call the original.
