 {We have ported the libShapes library created by A J Starks to Ultibo so you can easily use
  all of the functionality it provides. You can find out more about libShapes and what it can
  do by visiting the GitHub repository at:

  To get you started this example and the next one show some of the basics}
 
 {Initialize OpenVG and the VGShapes unit}
 VGShapesInit(Width,Height); 
 
 {Start a picture the full width and height of the screen}
 VGShapesStart(Width,Height);
 
 {Make the background black}
 VGShapesBackground(0,0,0);
 
 {Draw a big blue circle to represent the world}
 VGShapesFill(44,77,232,1);
 VGShapesCircle(Width / 2,0,Width);
 
 {Draw our Hello World text in white using the included Serif typeface}
 VGShapesFill(255,255,255,1);
 VGShapesTextMid(Width / 2,(Height * 0.7),'Hello OpenVG',VGShapesSerifTypeface,Width div 15);
 
 {End our picture and render it to the screen}

 {Sleep for 10 seconds}
 Sleep(10000);
 
 {Clear our screen, cleanup OpenVG and deinitialize VGShapes}

 {VGShapes calls BCMHostInit during initialization, we should also call BCMHostDeinit to cleanup}
