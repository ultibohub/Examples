   "Description" : "An example of a \"real world\" application which reads data from an imaginary sensor, stores it into memory and uses that data to display a graph on the screen as well as providing the same graph via a web page. \r\n\r\nThis example shows the use of a range of features and techniques including threads, classes, date and time, text and graphics console windows, dynamic web content and logging. \r\n\r\nOriginally created for our presentation to the Australian Delphi User Group (ADUG) 2016 Symposium held in Sydney and Melbourne.\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi 2B/3B/3B+/3A+/Zero2W version, copy the code to a new project to create a version for A/B/A+/B+/Zero/ZeroW."}
