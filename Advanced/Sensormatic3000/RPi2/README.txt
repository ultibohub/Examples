Advanced example - Sensormatic 3000

An example of a "real world" application which reads data from an imaginary sensor, stores it into memory and uses that data to display a graph on the screen as well as providing the same graph via a web page.

This example shows the use of a range of features and techniques including threads, classes, date and time, text and graphics console windows, dynamic web content and logging.

Originally created for our presentation to the Australian Delphi User Group (ADUG) 2016 Symposium held in Sydney and Melbourne.

Raspberry Pi 2B/3B version, copy the code to a new project to create a version for A/B/A+/B+/Zero.
