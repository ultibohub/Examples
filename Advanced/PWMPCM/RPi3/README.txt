Advanced example - PWM PCM

An example of playing a PCM sound sample using the PWM device, unlike Example 20 which uses DMA to play the sound this example
feeds the audio samples directly into the FIFO buffer. See the project header for more information.

Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+/3A+/Zero2W version, copy the code to a new project and modify where noted to create a version for A/B/A+/B+/Zero/ZeroW/2B.
