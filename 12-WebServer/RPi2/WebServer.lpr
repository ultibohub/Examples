{  Once compiled copy the kernel7.img file to an SD card along with the        }
{  firmware files and use it to boot your Raspberry Pi.                        }

 {Now, you might have noticed that we included the Shell and RemoteShell units
  above, these should have registered themselves and started a Telnet server so
  if you open up a telnet program like PuTTY and telnet (not SSH) to the IP address
  shown for the web server you should get a connection, have fun.}
