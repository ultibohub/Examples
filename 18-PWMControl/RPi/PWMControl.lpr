 {First locate the PWM devices
 
  The Raspberry Pi has two PWM channels which will normally end up with the names
  PWM0 and PWM1 when the driver is included in an application.
  
  You could also use PWMDeviceFindByDescription() here and use the contants defined
  in the BCM2709 unit for BCM2709_PWM0_DESCRIPTION and BCM2709_PWM1_DESCRIPTION.
  
  Those values are for Raspberry Pi 2 so you would adjust to use BCM2708 or BCM2710 for
  the Raspberry Pi A/B/A+/B+/Zero or Raspberry Pi 3 respectively. The names of the 
  constants also change to BCM2708 or BCM2710 for the different models as well}
 
 PWM0Device:=PWMDeviceFindByName('PWM0');
 PWM1Device:=PWMDeviceFindByName('PWM1');
 if (PWM0Device <> nil) and (PWM1Device <> nil) then
  begin
   {This example uses the default GPIO pin values which are GPIO_PIN_18 for PWM0
    and GPIO_PIN_19 for PWM1. If you need to use one of the alternate GPIO pins
    then you can call PWMDeviceSetGPIO() with the required pin number. 
    
    You can also use PWMDeviceGetGPIO() to find out the currently configured pin}
   
   {On the Raspberry Pi the PWM setup requires 3 values. 
   
    The first is the Mode which can be PWM_MODE_MARKSPACE, PWM_MODE_BALANCED or 
    PWM_MODE_SERIALIZED. These are described in detail in the BCM2835 ARM Peripherals
    documentation which can be found via the resources page on the Ultibo wiki.
    
    The second value is the Frequency which controls the frequency of the clock
    used by the PWM device. On the Raspberry Pi both PWM devices share a common
    clock so changing the frequency on one device also changes it on the other.
    
    The final setup value is the Range, the exact meaning of the range value varies
    depending on the mode selected but in general it represents the time period of
    one full cycle of the waveform output by the device.

    The range and the data define what is actually output onto the GPIO pin, as an
    alternative to setting them individually you can call PWMDeviceConfigure() which
    allows you to specify both a Range and a Duty cycle in nanoseconds.
    
    Try experimenting with the range and data values to see how they affect the LEDs}
    
   {Setup PWM device 0}
   {Set the range to 1000} 
   PWMDeviceSetRange(PWM0Device,1000);
   {And the mode to PWM_MODE_MARKSPACE}
   PWMDeviceSetMode(PWM0Device,PWM_MODE_MARKSPACE);
   {Finally set the frequency to 9.6MHz}
   PWMDeviceSetFrequency(PWM0Device,9600000);
   
   {Setup PWM device 1}
   {Use exactly the same settings as PWM0}
   PWMDeviceSetRange(PWM1Device,1000);
   PWMDeviceSetMode(PWM1Device,PWM_MODE_MARKSPACE);
   PWMDeviceSetFrequency(PWM1Device,9600000);
 
   {Start the PWM devices
   
    This will start the clock and enable the devices, the final step to
    output something is to write some actual data which will specify how
    many pulses are output within the time period defined by the range.
    
    A data value of 0 will turn off the output whereas a data value equal 
    to the range will mean the output is always on (pulses are continuous).
    We can use this to make our LED go from fully off to fully on in gradual
    steps, the time it takes to make this transition is simply controlled by
    the value passed to Sleep()}

     {Stop the PWM devices
     
      This will disable the devices and stop the clock, remember that the
      clock is shared between both devices so the driver will only actually
      stop the clock when PWMDeviceStop() is called for both of them}
