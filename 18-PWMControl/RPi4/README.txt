Example 18 PWM Control

An example demonstrating how to use PWM devices in Ultibo, we cycle a pair of LEDs from fully off to fully on with a gradually increasing brightness.

You'll need a couple of LEDs and a pair of resistors plus some wire to try out this example. Also recommended would be a breadboard or breakout board connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header to avoid the possibility of accidentally damaging the Pi.
