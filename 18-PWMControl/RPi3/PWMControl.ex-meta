   "Description" : "An example demonstrating how to use PWM devices in Ultibo, we cycle a pair of LEDs from fully off to fully on with a gradually increasing brightness.\r\n\r\nYou'll need a couple of LEDs and a pair of resistors plus some wire to try out this example. Also recommended would be a breadboard or breakout board connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO header to avoid the possibility of accidentally damaging the Pi.\r\n\r\nRaspberry Pi 3B/3B+/3A+/Zero2W version"}
