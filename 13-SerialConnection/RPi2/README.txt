Example 13 Serial Connection

The first example that shows interfacing with the world using the peripheral devices, for this example you will need some extra equipment to try it out. 

You will need to connect the Raspberry Pi to your computer using a serial connection, this could be a direct connection to a serial port or it could be a USB to serial converter.

By default the serial (UART) device on the Raspberry Pi will be on pins 14 (Transmit) and 15 (Receive) plus you need to connect a Ground wire as well, to see where the pins are located look at the documentation:

Raspberry Pi Model A and B

Raspberry Pi Models A+/A+/Zero/2B/3B

You will also need a terminal program like PuTTY on your computer to open the appropriate COM port and type some characters.
