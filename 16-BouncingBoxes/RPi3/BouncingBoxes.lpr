{Since this example was originally ported from C source code a couple of optimizations
 were needed in order to get the frame rate high enough for the animation to run smoothly.
 
 Out of interest the 'orignal' functions plus another variation have been left here to
 show the optimization process.
 
 The functions PutPixel() and FillRect1() were ported directly from the C source but under
 Free Pascal the calculation of the PixelOffset value for each pixel in the frame is far
 too slow (it's possible that the C compiler did extra optimization on the original).
 
 The FillRect2() function is an intermediate step which improved the rate dramatically but
 still needed a little more so it was replaced by the final FillRect() which delivers the
 full 60 frames per second at any screen size}

    Since the Raspberry Pi uses both Level 1 and Level 2 caching in order to
    improve the performance it may have only written our pixels to cache so 
    far and not to memory.
    
    Because the graphics processor (GPU) is separate from the CPU it cannot
    see into the CPU cache so we need to clean the cache to make the CPU
    write everything to memory. The framebuffer properties gives us a flag

    This would produce a tearing effect of horizontal lines on the screen which
    doesn't look good for our smooth animation.
    
    In order to handle this we check the framebuffer properties to see if the
    device supports waiting for vertical sync (the time between each frame)

    propogate through the system. To do this properly we really should tell the console
    not to attach to the framebuffer during boot, one of the many details needed when 
    creating real world applications}

   {Now we can adjust the framebuffer properties so that the color depth is 8 bits per
    pixel and the virtual height is twice the physical height which will give us two
    pages to draw our animation on. Again if we were doing this in a real application
    it would be best to check the flags first to see if the framebuffer device even
    supports virtual width and height}

    to be any reason to do this. The animation works at any size but you can try out the
    different values yourself for fun}

   {Because we set 8 bit color for the framebuffer to do this example we also
    need to set a palette. The framebuffer device or the driver might provide 
    a default palette but the simplest option is to set the one we want.
    
    Here we pass a prebuilt structure that contains the VGA Mode 13h color
    palette (or at least one version of it)}

    address of the framebuffer memory and also the length of each line in bytes
