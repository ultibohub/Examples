  drive because we didn't include the USB host driver.}

 {To list the contents we need to use FindFirst/FindNext, start with FindFirst}
 if FindFirst('C:\*.*',faAnyFile,SearchRec) = 0 then

 {Let's try creating a file and writing some text to it, we'll assign our filename
  to a variable.}

   all the strings to our new file.}

   {And use LoadFromStream to read it}
   ConsoleWindowWriteLn(WindowHandle,'Loading the TStringList from the file');
   StringList.LoadFromStream(FileStream);

   {Iterate the strings and print them to the screen}

   {If you remove the SD card and put in back in your computer, you should see the

    see the contents exactly as they appeared on screen.}
